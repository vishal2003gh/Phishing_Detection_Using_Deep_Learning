# Phishing_Detection_Using_Deep_Learning
This is a URL-Based Phishing Detection System developed using deep learning architectures like LSTM and CNN. In simple words this model takes the URL as input and based on the trained model it classifies whether the URL is legitimate or Phishing. Results: Accuracy : 99.34% F1-Score : 99.34% Recall : 98.83% Precision: 99.86%

The app.py contains the UI code which is developed using FLASK.

The Model Training & Evaluation contains the Data Preprocessing code, Model Training code and Model Evaluation Code. 
NOTE: Model is preprocessed, trained and evaluated on google colab.

The Index.html contains the frontend code for attractive UI. It has embedded CSS and JavaScript codes in it.

NOTE: Choose a dataset from kaggle or phishtank and modify Model Training & Evaluation according to your dataset.
